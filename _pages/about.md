I am an third year PhD candidate in the Department of Electrical Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU), advised by [Dr. Jae-sun Seo](https://faculty.engineering.asu.edu/jseo/). Before joining the direct PhD program at ASU, I completed my Bachelor of Science degree in Electrical Engineering from Portland State University. In addition to the research at ASU, I've also spent great time on collaboration/internship with multiple top-tier research facilities and universities, including Texas Instrument, ARM, KAIST, Georgia Tech, and University of Pennsylvania.
